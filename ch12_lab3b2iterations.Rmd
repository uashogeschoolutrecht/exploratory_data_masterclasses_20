## The map functions

The pattern of looping over a vector, doing something to each element and saving the results is so common that the purrr package provides a family of functions to do it for you. There is one function for each type of output:

* `map()`     makes a list.
* `map_lgl()` makes a logical vector.
* `map_int()` makes an integer vector.
* `map_dbl()` makes a double vector.
* `map_chr()` makes a character vector.
* `map_df()`

Each function takes a vector as input, applies a function to each piece, and then returns a new vector that's the same length (and has the same names) as the input. The type of the vector is determined by the suffix to the map function. 

Once you master these functions, you'll find it takes much less time to solve iteration problems. But you should never feel bad about using a for loop instead of a map function. The map functions are a step up a tower of abstraction, and it can take a long time to get your head around how they work. The important thing is that you solve the problem that you're working on, not write the most concise and elegant code (although that's definitely something you want to strive towards!).

Some people will tell you to avoid for loops because they are slow. They're wrong! (Well at least they're rather out of date, as for loops haven't been slow for many years). The chief benefits of using functions like `map()` is not speed, but clarity: they make your code easier to write and to read.

We can use these functions to perform the same computations as the last for loop. Those summary functions returned doubles, so we need to use `map_dbl()`:


```{r}
df <- tibble(a = c(1:9, -999), 
             b = c(1:5, -999, -999, 8:10),
             c = LETTERS[1:10])
df
```


```{r}
map_dbl(df, mean)
map_dbl(df, median)
map_dbl(df, sd)
```

Compared to using a for loop, focus is on the operation being performed (i.e. `mean()`, `median()`, `sd()`), not the bookkeeping required to loop over every element and store the output. This is even more apparent if we use the pipe:

```{r}
df %>% map_dbl(mean)
df %>% map_dbl(median)
df %>% map_dbl(sd)
```

There are a few differences between `map_*()` and `col_summary()`:

*   All purrr functions are implemented in C. This makes them a little faster
    at the expense of readability.
    
*   The second argument, `.f`, the function to apply, can be a formula, a 
    character vector, or an integer vector. You'll learn about those handy 
    shortcuts in the next section.
    
*   `map_*()` uses ... ([dot dot dot]) to pass along additional arguments 
    to `.f` each time it's called:

    ```{r}
    map_dbl(df, mean, trim = 0.5)
    ```

*   The map functions also preserve names:

    ```{r}
    z <- list(x = 1:3, y = 4:5)
    map_int(z, length)
    ```

### Shortcuts

There are a few shortcuts that you can use with `.f` in order to save a little typing. Imagine you want to fit a linear model to each group in a dataset. The following toy example splits the up the `mtcars` dataset in to three pieces (one for each value of cylinder) and fits the same linear model to each piece:  

```{r}
models <- mtcars %>% 
  split(.$cyl) %>% 
  map(function(df) lm(mpg ~ wt, data = df))
```

The syntax for creating an anonymous function in R is quite verbose so purrr provides a convenient shortcut: a one-sided formula.

```{r}
models <- mtcars %>% 
  split(.$cyl) %>% 
  map(~lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .))
```


When you're looking at many models, you might want to extract a summary statistic like the $R^2$. To do that we need to first run `summary()` and then extract the component called `r.squared`. We could do that using the shorthand for anonymous functions:

```{r}
models %>% 
  map(summary) %>% 
  map_dbl(~.$r.squared)
```

But extracting named components is a common operation, so purrr provides an even shorter shortcut: you can use a string.

```{r}
models %>% 
  map(summary) %>% 
  map_dbl("r.squared")
```

You can also use an integer to select elements by position: 


## Mapping over multiple arguments

So far we've mapped along a single input. But often you have multiple related inputs that you need iterate along in parallel. That's the job of the `map2()` and `pmap()` functions. For example, imagine you want to simulate some random normals with different means. You know how to do that with `map()`:

```{r}
mu <- list(5, 10, -3)
mu %>% 
  map(rnorm, n = 5) %>% 
  str()
```

What if you also want to vary the standard deviation? One way to do that would be to iterate over the indices and index into vectors of means and sds:

```{r}
sigma <- list(1, 5)
seq_along(mu) %>% 
  map(~rnorm(5, mu[[.]], sigma[[.]])) %>% 
  str()
```

But that obfuscates the intent of the code. Instead we could use `map2()` which iterates over two vectors in parallel:

```{r}
rnorm(100000) %>% hist
rnorm(100, mean = 2, sd = 0.1)

## map2 - can be used in a case where the function you want to loop needs two arguments
map2(mu, sigma, rnorm, n = 1000) %>% enframe() 
```

`map2()` generates this series of function calls:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/lists-map2.png")
```

Note that the arguments that vary for each call come _before_ the function; arguments that are the same for every call come _after_.

Like `map()`, `map2()` is just a wrapper around a for loop:

```{r}
map2 <- function(x, y, f, ...) {
  out <- vector("list", length(x))
  for (i in seq_along(x)) {
    out[[i]] <- f(x[[i]], y[[i]], ...)
  }
  out
}
```

You could also imagine `map3()`, `map4()`, `map5()`, `map6()` etc, but that would get tedious quickly. Instead, purrr provides `pmap()` which takes a list of arguments. You might use that if you wanted to vary the mean, standard deviation, and number of samples:

```{r}
n <- list(1, 3, 5)
args1 <- list(n, mu, sigma)
args1 %>%
  pmap(rnorm) %>% 
  str()
```

That looks like:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/lists-pmap-unnamed.png")
```

If you don't name the elements of list, `pmap()` will use positional matching when calling the function. That's a little fragile, and makes the code harder to read, so it's better to name the arguments:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
args2 <- list(mean = mu, sd = sigma, n = n)
args2 %>% 
  pmap(rnorm) %>% 
  str()
```

Since the arguments are all the same length, it makes sense to store them in a data frame:

```{r}





params <- tribble(
  ~mean, ~sd, ~n,
    5,     1,  1,
   10,     5,  3,
   -3,    10,  5
)
params %>% 
  pmap(rnorm)
```

As soon as your code gets complicated, I think a data frame is a good approach because it ensures that each column has a name and is the same length as all the other columns.


## Walk {#walk}

Walk is an alternative to map that you use when you want to call a function for its side effects, rather than for its return value. You typically do this because you want to render output to the screen or save files to disk - the important thing is the action, not the return value. Here's a very simple example:

```{r}
x <- list(1, "a", 3)

x %>% 
  walk(print)
```

`walk()` is generally not that useful compared to `walk2()` or `pwalk()`. For example, if you had a list of plots and a vector of file names, you could use `pwalk()` to save each file to the corresponding location on disk:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
plots <- mtcars %>% 
  split(.$cyl) %>% 
  map(~ggplot(., aes(mpg, wt)) + geom_point())
paths <- stringr::str_c(names(plots), ".pdf")

pwalk(list(paths, plots), ggsave, path = tempdir())
```

`walk()`, `walk2()` and `pwalk()` all invisibly return `.x`, the first argument. This makes them suitable for use in the middle of pipelines. 

## Other patterns of for loops

Purrr provides a number of other functions that abstract over other types of for loops. You'll use them less frequently than the map functions, but they're useful to know about. The goal here is to briefly illustrate each function, so hopefully it will come to mind if you see a similar problem in the future. Then you can go look up the documentation for more details.


### Reduce and accumulate

Sometimes you have a complex list that you want to reduce to a simple list by repeatedly applying a function that reduces a pair to a singleton. This is useful if you want to apply a two-table dplyr verb to multiple tables. For example, you might have a list of data frames, and you want to reduce to a single data frame by joining the elements together:

```{r}
dfs <- list(
  age = tibble(name = "John", age = 30),
  sex = tibble(name = c("John", "Mary"), sex = c("M", "F")),
  trt = tibble(name = "Mary", treatment = "A")
)

dfs %>% reduce(full_join)
```

Or maybe you have a list of vectors, and want to find the intersection:

```{r}
vs <- list(
  c(1, 3, 5, 6, 10),
  c(1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10),
  c(1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10)
)

vs %>% reduce(intersect)
```

The reduce function takes a "binary" function (i.e. a function with two primary inputs), and applies it repeatedly to a list until there is only a single element left.

Accumulate is similar but it keeps all the interim results. You could use it to implement a cumulative sum:

```{r}
x <- sample(10)
x
x %>% accumulate(`+`)
```
